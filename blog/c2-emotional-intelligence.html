<h2>Reflection about the chapter</h2>
<p>Chapter one of Search Inside Yourself book taught me the importance of EQ or Emotional Intelligence to achieve success in workplace or life.
  Which most people still measuring IQ to measure each individual's success rate.</p>
<p>Moreover, the six out of four competencies key success even in the tech sector are coming from EQ. This includes, strong achievement standards, ability to influence, self-confidence and initiative on taking challenge.
  Therefore, to achieve those four competencies each individual needs to have self-motivation, resilience and self-regulation.</p>
<p>Other than that, two minutes mindfullness taught me how to let go stress if I got stuck at some point. This is very similar to what I usually do, I called it QiGong, a meditation technique that I learned from Thailand.
  This meditation allows me to organise my breath within 30-40 minutes and let go off my stress and anxiety. Which helps me to get all of my tasks done.</p>
