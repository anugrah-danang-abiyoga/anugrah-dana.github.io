                    <li>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</li>
                    <p>Life seems very rewarding although it needs struggle and rewarding. However, this lens made people have the purpose to have the reason to wake up everyday</p>
                    <li>From discovering values and higher purpose exercise, What are your core values and what do you stand for?</li>
                    <p>I do think my core values are happiness, hardwork and education. Whereas my I stand for equality and equity. This is because I believe these core and what I stand for drives me to pursue my entrepreneurial dream</p>
                    <li>How did you find resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</li>
                    <p>I found it very interesting and helpful as I now understand that failure and success is part of the person's emotions. Other than that, it is good to let go of failure, as it is to make a person become better because it is part of the experience</p>
