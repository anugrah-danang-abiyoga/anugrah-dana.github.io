                    <li>What is your experience on compasionate leadership?</li>
                    <p>Based on the Search Inside Yourself book. I had a similar experience. In my previous workplace I had work together with my team and try to close to them on the field. However, because of his lower performance my manager seems did not quite happy with their results. Therefore, I teach them the basic how to sell again from the start 
                      so then at least they can produce some sales. At the same time I tried to talk to my manager that actually they are trying their best, however they need more time to produce big numbers of sales and I also explain to him that this is also due to the culture shock, as they just arrived in NZ. In the end my manager give them a chance and I still talk to him until now.

                    <li>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</li>
                    <p>I do think it is very powerful. I think i strengthen my purposes why I do my job, why I study EDA. Simply, because I want to create better environment for other people back in my home country as well as in New Zealand. Other than that, I also do remember people who are supporting me and also who does not. However, when I do think people that did not really support my idea, 
                      I feel that it is something that made me strengthen my beliefs and made me realise that it is actually something that made me stronger individual.

                    <li>Do the tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</li>
                    <p>I found that I can see myself struggle with the pressure that came from my ego. In this case, I am afraid of being failure not meeting expectation of my family in Indonesia in terms of career. However, I still see myself have a little bit struggle with my depression that happened in December which made me couldn't do my EDA work and lose motivation. Having tried this made myself 
                      realise that actually, slowly with open heart, positive and understanding myself is actually made myself ease and make myself have a resolution as well as being more positive a about my ambition.

                    <li>How does SCARF model apply to your phase-0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</li>
                    <p>I think somehow it applied as the phase-0 is also made me explore all the possibilities that can be happen later on the bootcamp. Therefore I do think in the bootcamp, it all SCARF model will be applied as it is very similar with what happened in most of the workplace</p>
                    <li>Have a difficult conversation?</li>
                    <p>Generally speaking. I didn't really have difficulties in conversation even with stragers. However in this phase-0 it's just a bit difficult to connect just because I have other commitment outside that.</p>
