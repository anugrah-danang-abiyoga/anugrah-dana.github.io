                    <p>Based on the Search Inside Yourself book. I had a similar experience. In my previous workplace I had work together with my team and try to close to them on the field. However, because of his lower performance my manager seems did not quite happy with their results. Therefore, I teach them the basic how to sell again from the start 
                      so then at least they can produce some sales. At the same time I tried to talk to my manager that actually they are trying their best, however they need more time to produce big numbers of sales and I also explain to him that this is also due to the culture shock, as they just arrived in NZ. In the end my manager give them a chance and I still talk to him until now.
