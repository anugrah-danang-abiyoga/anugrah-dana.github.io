              <li>What did you learn about Mindfulness conversation?</li>
              <p>I did learn that having mindfulness in both formal and informal conversation give person an ability to become more objective, better speaker and better listener.</p>
              <li>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</li>
              <p>I think I will use the take one day breath, as I am a person that rarely stops working. Plus, currently I am not studying for my Developer course but I have 2 jobs. So it will be useful for me.</p>
              <li>Any other musings?</li>
              <p>Mindfulness is very helpful for each people within the organisation as it will increase the effectivity of the teamwork</p>
