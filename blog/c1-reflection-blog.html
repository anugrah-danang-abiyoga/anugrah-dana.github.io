          <li>What's your take on the EDA Experience?</li>
          <p>I am very excited to start the bootcamp. This is because I would like to meet new people.
            Especially for those who have a different background and culture.</p>
          <li>What are your impressions?</li>
          <p>There are two impressions that I got. The first is that the a very welcoming environment towards different background.
            The second is the culture that accept imperfection, which is a big thing for me.</p>
