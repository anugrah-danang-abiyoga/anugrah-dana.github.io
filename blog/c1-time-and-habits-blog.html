                <li>Which timebox habits and techniques did you try?</li>
                <p>Everytime I get overwhelmed by tasks, I will always go for meditation to make my mind relax in order to not get overwhelmed.
                  Other than that, I tried a little bit of "getting into the zone" mental state</p>
                <li>What did you find interesting</li>
                <p>I found that all techniques are interesting. This is because all of them are trying to help people get their things done and better.
                  Moreover, it also makes people get their task done not only in an efficient and effective manners but also enhance creativity</p>
                <li>What worked for you?</li>
                <p>I do think that meditation and getting into the zone state is suitable for me. It is probably because I am an introverted yet competitive</p>
                <li>Which will you experiment further with?</li>
                <p>Most probably I will try Pomodoro Techniques. because it enhance people to work more effectively both individually and team</p>
