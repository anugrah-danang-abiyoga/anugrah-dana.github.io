          <ul>
            <li>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and DOM? How would you explain to your non technical friend?</li>
            <p>The best analogy for those three is House. HTML is the foundation, like walls and the floors. CSS is the style of the house
              such as the colour of the walls and the floors. Whereas DOM is to make your house "smart" for example the garage that can be controlled by a remote</p>
            <li>What is meant by boxifying design?</li>
            <p>Since all web pages made up from the boxes, boxifying design is reintrepret about the design of the web page according to how many box that can be counted in the web page</p>
            <li>What is box model?</li>
            <p>It is the foundation on layout of web page. Which based from content, padding, border and margin</p>
