                  <li>The story about my journey in this Web Developer Course (stuck moment) and how I solved it</li>
                  <p>There are two moments that I was stuck. The first moment was when I tried to redesign my site. That moment I was struggling with how to have a good layers of 'div'. However, finally after searching an hour for an answer on the internet I found the solution was only because I was not patient enough to wait for my site to change and I already did the right code!.
                    the second was when I was doing my Javascript assignment, I forgot to use space and it made me stuck for half an hour!. Therefore, what I did learn is to be patient and also become more attentive to details as coding in HTML, CSS and Javascript requires both of it</p>
                  <li>How confident I am in using these problem-solving techniques?</li>
                  <p>pseudocode: I am generally confident in using this as this is helpful to be used for DOM</p>
                  <p>trying something: I am mostly confident doing trial and error as it is part of the learning</p>
                  <p>rubber ducky method: honestly, I haven't tried this one but from what I read in google I think it is pretty interesting</p>
                  <p>reading error message: I don't whether it is as useful as the other. But at least I know something is wrong with the code</p>
                  <p>console.log: well console log is useful when testing whether the code that I write is right or wrong</p>
                  <p>Googling: I am the most comfortable using this as I like to google every example. Especially when doing Javascript</p>
                  <p>Asking peers: I usually asking Priya if I stuck on something. But I still have to learn everything by myself first before asking question to other people</p>
                  <p>Asking teacher: Harrison is the person who I often asked if I get really really stuck</p>
                  <p>Reflection: I have managed everything well I guess for the last two weeks as I can catch up and try one sprint one week</p>
                  <li>Explain to non-tech friend what are .map(), .filter(), and .reduce().</li>
                  <p>.map() function is when you want to change you array you can use this function and makes it separate. filter function is to look a specific criteria. whereas reduce function is reduce array element into one value</p>
