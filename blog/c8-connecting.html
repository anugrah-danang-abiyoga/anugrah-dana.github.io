                      <li>Have you tried using any of the insight techniques for growing trust and sincerity?</li>
                      <p>I kind of trying it in a way with my current job. Growing trust is also using 'just like me' statement as well as treating them as a human being and be willing to listen to their problem</p>
                      <li>Try emphatetic listening, How did it go?</li>
                      <p>I found it very interesting. This is also what I usually did when I was coaching and motivating the sales team, by having this and understand their problem that is where they can improve and getting out the best of themselves</p>
                      <li>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</li>
                      <p>I found this meditation is like when I pray. I prayed for me so that God is always with me and avoiding me from suffering and I also pray so that people in my circle will always have a good luck</p>
                      <li>Complete the political awareness in writing</li>
                      <p>In my previous work, where I am still in Indonesia. There is a conflict between Sales and Finance department. The Sales department said that the customer can actually have last month tax pay, as the customer wanting to know that the company where I work always pay tax or not.
                          However, The Finance team said that they do not like it. Because it is something confidential and the customer should know that our company having an international reputation and have been here in Indonesia for a very long time. As an outsider perspective, both of the department 
                          try to do good, sales department wanting to get a sale for the company at the same time finance department wanting to keep company's confidentiality.
                      </p>
