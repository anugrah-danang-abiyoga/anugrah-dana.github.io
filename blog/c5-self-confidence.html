              <ul>
                <li>What is the relationship between self-confidence and mindfulness?</li>
                <p>the relationship is mindfulness is where ourseleves feel calm and feel joyous where self-confidence is when people know their recovery mode, success mode and failure mode.
                  Therefore, when the person have both mindfulness and self-confidence he / she will have a judgement about their sucess, failures and how to improve it.</p>
                <li>Try at least one one of the self-awareness practices (body scanning or journaling), What was your experience? how did you feel?</li>
                <p>I tried Journaling, and I had a better judgement about my performance, both my strengths and my weaknesses, as well as what can be done to improve those</p>
                <li>What did you take away from the "my Emotions are not me" section?</li>
                <p>I leaned that changing subtle language will affect better judgement to ourselves, as we are aware of our emotions, we are able to control our emotions to face any difficult situation</p>
