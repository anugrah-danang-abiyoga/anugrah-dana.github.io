            <li>What are frameworks are? and their pros and cons?</li>
            <p>It is a package or pre-designed that made up by of a structure files and folders of standardized code e.g. HTML, CSS and Javscript as a basis to build the website.
              The pros are it makes people easier to build their own website, because once they know how these operate then it will be easier for every people to build the website.

            <p>Wireframe is the breakdown of the website which is like the blueprint of the house. It often use by web developer to make a plan of what kind of web page that they want to build.

              <div class="row">
                <div class="columns three">
                  <img src="../images/Desktop-Index.jpg" />
                </div>
                <div class="columns three">
                  <img src="../images/Desktop-Blog.jpg" />
                </div>
                <div class="columns three">

                </div>
                <div class="columns three">
                  <img src="../images/Mobile-Index.jpg" />
                </div>
              </div>
              <li>The aspects of your wireframe image is difficult to implement, why?</li>
              <p>For me, it is because there are many codes that I want to experiment with. Moreover, I still found it hard to make my website suits for the mobile.</p>
