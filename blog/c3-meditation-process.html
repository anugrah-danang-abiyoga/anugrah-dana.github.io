              <li>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</li>
              <p> I think it affects me that process is allow me to experimenting new things so that I don't really mind if my code expriment fail but at least I learn along the process.</p>
              <li>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</li>
              <p>As I usually did with my meditation is I train to balancing my mind, relaxing my mind as well as being alert of my body. Due to the movement of QiGong that I usually do.</p>
              <li>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</li>
              <p>The things that I learnt is that there is a scientific reason behind it, so it can be easily understood by people who doesn't usually do meditation.</p>
              <li>Did any of the suggested meditation technique stand out to you?</li>
              <p>I think traditional buddhism meditation is stand out for me. Which is interesting that there is a scientific research behind this traditional method.</p>
              <li>Any other musings</li>
              <p>I do think that every workplace needs to have meditation time for the employee. Which I think they will have a better performance in the workplace, as they will have calmer mind</p>
